- should keep BOTH -Og AND not disable "omit-frame-pointer" otherwise we get a huge
  increase of stack usage (leading to stack overflow, with 8MB stack size)

- should keep "tree-coalesce-vars" otherwise we get this warning:
src/interpret.cpp:346:17: warning: variable ‘function’ might be clobbered by ‘longjmp’ or ‘vfork’ [-Wclobbered]
  346 |     const auto& function = std::get<prim_value_t::Lambda>(fnPrimValPtr->variant);
      |                 ^~~~~~~~

- we are disabling any other optimization coming from -Og,
  in order to achieve best debuggability (similar to -O0)
  BUT with a reasonable stack usage.

- it is NOT the same as doing `-O0 -fomit-frame-pointer -ftree-coalesce-vars`
  because -O0 completely bypasses the SSA (Static Single Assignment) Optimizer Pipeline.
  -> so we need -Og and a very long list of -fno-xxx, unfortunately
    -> so i created a CXX function, wrapper of g++ or ccache g++, in
       env.sh, and in the Makefile we say $(CXX) should resolve into
       CXX (as a program name, to look for in the shell env).
       So that we don't clutter Makefile command logging with all
       our optimization options. (But we can still check it with
       `what CXX`, or even toggle ccache in env.sh + source it again)
